# medical-text-data-classifier

In this repository some famous ML algorithms such as SVM, KNN, etc are implemented to make medical text classifiers on a dataset with 23 topics as classes. You can find the code for all these algorithms in main.ipynb.  
A CNN is also implemented on this dataset using Keras library in MedicalTextDeepClassifier.ipynb.
